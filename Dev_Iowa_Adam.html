				<p> Greetings, folks at Dev/Iowa!  My name is Adam.  I am currently a high school teacher with Teach for America. My dream is to become a full stack software developer.  
				I'm excited about the possibility of joining y'all in Iowa City!  Although I have enjoyed teaching myself the basics
				of HTML, CSS, and Ruby, I'm done squeaking out practice time in the evenings and weekends.  I'm ready to throw myself
				into the immersive bootcamp experience!</p>

<div id="Why_Me" style="border: 5px dotted black" >
	<h1 style="text-align:center">Why Me?</h1>

	<p>I'm sure y'all are inundated with hopeful applicants to your program, but hopefully I stand out to you as a memorable candidate.  After careful research of MANY
	coding bootcamps, I have selected Dev/Iowa for my number one choice!  I think your program is awesome because 
	it feeds into the major Mid-West markets, it is connected with one of country's most renowned research universities,
	it's affordibility, and it's emphasis on creating full-stack developers.</p>

	<p>I am convinced that you all are awesome!  I hope that I can convince you that I'm awesome too.
	Three things that make me unqiue from other applicants are my curiousity, determination, and passion for
	creating beautiful things.</p>
